WeatherApp

A simple and modern weather application built with SwiftUI, consuming the OpenWeatherMap API to display the current weather of any city.

Designed as part of my portfolio to showcase best practices in iOS development: MVVM architecture, API consumption, state management, and reactive UI using SwiftUI.
